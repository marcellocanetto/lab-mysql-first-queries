**6. Take the 10 apps best rated by users.**
see the ranking in the Table “rating” in db “applestore”

**7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.**
Top 10 most rated apps are mainly Social Network, Games and Music apps

**8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.**
Top 10 best rated are mostly Games or Fitness apps

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**
The most rated apps are not present in the ranking of the best rated, e viceversa, which allows me to conclude that a high number or ratings decrease the probability to have a high rating score

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?**

**11. Does people care about the price?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
I have created 4 queries where I have compared the rating count, user rating and the price, applying different conditions on user rating and price to see all the possible scenarios.
